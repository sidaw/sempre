notes:

goals:
	get exposure to the field
	NLP that isn't ML?
	NNs?
	something concrete, want to move fast

projects
	Looking at another domain for blocks:

		what kind of task?
		what's a baseline?
	Applying NNs for blocks: NNs instead of log-linear model. It seems that is pretty standard


x.ai
one-shot neural nets
